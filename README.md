**LA Wildfire Disaster Relief Inventory Platform
****Project Overview
**During a natural disaster, victims often face the overwhelming task of documenting property loss for insurance while in a state of crisis. This platform was developed to bridge the gap between high-stress recovery and the rigorous data requirements of insurance adjusters.

**The Problem
**Manual Friction: Existing insurance forms are long, complex, and difficult to complete on mobile devices.

Data Loss: Families often lose physical receipts or forget items when evacuated, leading to undervalued claims.

Process Opacity: Users lack real-time visibility into the status of their submitted claims.

**The Solution (MVP Features)
**Frictionless Logging: A simplified "add item" flow designed for mobile use in the field.

Visual Documentation: Integrated photo and receipt upload to satisfy insurer proof-of-loss requirements.

Claim Roadmap: A visual progress tracker to reduce user anxiety by showing exactly where they are in the settlement process.

Accessible UI: High-contrast, clean interface optimized for users experiencing high cognitive load.
